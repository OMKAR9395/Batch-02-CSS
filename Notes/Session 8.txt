Grid system 
How it works
Css grid = working like webpage boxes
Rows and Columns

Grid = 2 Dimentional layout system
it working parent child relation
display:grid		=>	container
	grid items	=>	child

Column
	grid-template-columns: <value>

	fr	=	available space
	is mostly used for responsive

	Fr is working on total available space of viewport

	total of fr = fr / 100 = how many % 
	total size of vieport

Row
grid-template-row :<value>

row column-gap row-gap

repeat(<how many times>,<size or fr>)

When Individualy column or row Moving
 
 Inside of child element
 			grid-column: 1/3;			<start,end>
            grid-row: 2/3;				<start,end>
			and also like its working in line system
